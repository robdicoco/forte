# Forte Wallet - Project Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Forte Wallet project, a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet developed as part of the NearX Post-Graduation Program.

**Classification:**
- âœ… **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product features to be implemented in initial release
- ðŸ”œ **Post-MVP**: Future enhancements and advanced features

---

## MVP Requirements

### 1. Key Management and Autonomy (Non-Custodial Core)

The core functionality of a digital cryptocurrency wallet is storing private keys for making cryptocurrency transactions.

#### 1.1 Key Generation âœ… MVP
- The wallet must be able to generate key pairs (public and private keys)
- The private key should be a randomly generated number
- The generated key pair and wallet information (private key, public key, public address) must be able to be saved and loaded
- Implementation using BIP39 seed phrase standard
- Support for Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet structure

#### 1.2 Public Address Derivation âœ… MVP
- The wallet must derive and show the public wallet address from the public key
- The address is necessary for receiving cryptocurrency
- Display address in user-friendly format (with checksum)

#### 1.3 Secure Storage (Client-Side) âœ… MVP
- Keys must be stored locally on the user's device (client-side in the extension or app)
- User is solely responsible for securing their private keys
- Private keys must NEVER be sent to any external server
- Keys stored encrypted in memory only, never persisted to disk in plain text

#### 1.4 Seed Phrase/Recovery âœ… MVP
- Support for recovery mechanism using seed phrase (BIP39 standard)
- Users can restore wallet from seed phrase
- Seed phrase must be displayable for user backup
- Users must be educated on the importance of private key security
- Encourage users to take steps to protect their assets

**Decision:** Using seed phrase approach (not keyless) for independence and user autonomy

---

### 2. Network Connectivity and Status âœ… MVP

The wallet must be able to interact with the underlying blockchain, as the assets themselves are stored on the network, not in the wallet.

#### 2.1 Network Connection âœ… MVP
- The wallet must be able to establish a connection to the target network
- Use Web3 JSON-RPC client or nodes/APIs
- For Ethereum-based assets, set up endpoint to connect to the network
- Support for multiple networks (Mainnet, Sepolia, Goerli testnets)
- Default RPC endpoint configuration with option for custom RPC

#### 2.2 Balance Retrieval âœ… MVP
- The wallet must be able to retrieve the user's asset balance from the network
- Display balance in common unit (ETH) rather than just native large unit (wei)
- Show balance with appropriate decimal places
- Auto-refresh balance on wallet activity

---

### 3. Transaction Execution âœ… MVP

The MVP must enable the user to spend the cryptocurrency they receive.

#### 3.1 Sending Capability âœ… MVP
- The wallet must support the ability to send cryptocurrency to other wallet addresses
- Transaction creation function specifying:
  - Recipient address (with validation)
  - Value (converted from ETH to wei for execution)
  - Gas price and gas limit configuration
  - Transaction data (optional, for smart contract interactions)

#### 3.2 Transaction Signing âœ… MVP
- The wallet must sign the transaction using the stored secret key
- Signing process constitutes digital authorization by the customer's private key
- Essential for non-custodial transaction execution
- Signed transaction must be verified before submission

#### 3.3 Transaction Submission âœ… MVP
- Implement functionality to send the raw, signed transaction to the blockchain network
- Provide transaction hash as receipt
- Handle transaction status tracking (pending, confirmed, failed)

---

### 4. User Interface âœ… MVP

#### 4.1 Primary Focus: User Experience (UX)
- **Strategic Decision:** Focus on enchanting UX for MVP
  - UX is what sells wallets to users
  - Security and fraud prevention are long-term priorities
  - Inspirational reference: xPortal from MultiversX

#### 4.2 Browser Extension Interface âœ… MVP
- Chrome extension (Manifest V3)
- Edge browser compatibility
- React-based user interface
- Responsive and intuitive design
- Minimalist but functional UI

#### 4.3 Account Management âœ… MVP
- Display wallet address
- Show account balance
- View transaction history
- Clear account information organization

---

### 5. Platform Delivery âœ… MVP

#### 5.1 Primary Platform: Browser Extension âœ… MVP
- **Decision:** Browser extension is fastest to deliver MVP
- Chrome and Edge support
- Desktop browser environment

#### 5.2 Desktop Application ðŸ”œ Post-MVP
- Desktop app can follow quickly after MVP
- Better isolated environment for security

---

### 6. Cryptocurrency Focus âœ… MVP

#### 6.1 Primary Chain: EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) âœ… MVP
- **Decision:** Focus on EVM as main chain
- Team is using Solidity base
- Ethereum ecosystem provides core requirements
- Support for ERC-20 tokens
- Ethereum mainnet and testnets

---

## Post-MVP Features

### 1. Multi-Chain Support ðŸ”œ Post-MVP
**Question:** Does multi-chain make sense?  
**Answer:** Yes, but MVP should focus on establishing the wallet model. Since team is using Solidity base, EVM is the primary requirement.

**Future Implementation:**
- Expand to Solana blockchain
- Cosmos ecosystem support
- Other EVM-compatible chains
- Cross-chain bridges

---

### 2. Multi-Signature Support ðŸ”œ Post-MVP
**Question:** Does multi-signature make sense?  
**Answer:** Yes, but leave it for post-MVP.

**Future Implementation:**
- Multi-sig wallet setup
- Co-signing workflows
- Threshold signature schemes
- Enterprise wallet support

---

### 3. NFT Support ðŸ”œ Post-MVP
**Question:** Should we have specific handling for NFTs in the wallet?  
**Answer:** Yes, but again after MVP.

**Future Implementation:**
- NFT gallery view
- NFT metadata display
- NFT transfer functionality
- NFT marketplace integration
- Collection management

---

### 4. Third-Party Wallet Tracking ðŸ”œ Post-MVP
**Question:** Does tracking third-party wallets make sense?  
**Answer:** Would be a good differentiator, but not for MVP. Enters investment recommendation territory.

**Future Implementation:**
- Watch-only mode for other addresses
- Portfolio aggregation across addresses
- Investment recommendations (advanced feature)

---

### 5. Account Abstraction ðŸ”œ Post-MVP
**Question:** Does Account Abstraction concept make sense?  
**Answer:** Depends on solution. Would go in keyless direction. May limit available networks and compatibility, but interesting for beginner users. Keep as extra feature.

**Future Implementation:**
- Smart contract wallet abstraction
- Social recovery mechanisms
- Gasless transactions
- Session keys

---

### 6. Off-Chain System Integration ðŸ”œ Post-MVP

**Future Implementation:**
- Payment channels integration
- State channels support
- Layer 2 solutions
- Off-chain data synchronization

---

### 7. Mobile Application ðŸ”œ Post-MVP
